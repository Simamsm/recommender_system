# YouTube Video Recommender System using Word Embeddings

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple recommender system that suggests YouTube videos based on a user-provided interest. The system uses **word embeddings** generated by FlagEmbedding model and calculates **cosine similarity** to recommend the most relevant videos.

The dataset used is a collection of trending YouTube videos, and the recommender system provides suggestions based on the video titles.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains metadata for trending YouTube videos, including the following columns:

- `video_id`: Unique identifier for the video
- `title`: Title of the YouTube video
- `publishedAt`: The date and time when the video was published
- `channelId`: The unique identifier for the channel
- `channelTitle`: The title of the channel that published the video
- `categoryId`: The category ID associated with the video
- `trending_date`: The date when the video started trending
- `tags`: Tags associated with the video
- `view_count`: The number of views the video has received
- `likes`: The number of likes the video has received
- `dislikes`: The number of dislikes the video has received
- `comment_count`: The number of comments on the video
- `thumbnail_link`: URL of the video's thumbnail image
- `comments_disabled`: Whether comments on the video are disabled
- `ratings_disabled`: Whether ratings (likes/dislikes) on the video are disabled
- `description`: A short description of the video content

Sample data looks like this:

| Unnamed: 0 | video_id   | title                                                    | publishedAt           | channelId                | channelTitle        | categoryId | trending_date | tags                                       | view_count | likes  | dislikes | comment_count | thumbnail_link                                   | comments_disabled | ratings_disabled | description                                           |

## Project Structure
- **recommender_system.ipynb**: The Python script implementing the recommender system.
- **GB_videos_data.csv**: The dataset containing the YouTube video metadata.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `scipy`

  ## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
   - Load the dataset, remove duplicates, and focus on the necessary columns: `title`, `description`, `view_count`, and `likes`.
   - Clean the titles by converting them to lowercase.

2. **Generate Word Embeddings**:
   - Use FlagEmbedding model to create embeddings for each video title.

3. **Recommendation System**:
   - The system accepts a user query, generates an embedding for it, and calculates cosine similarity between the query and all video titles.
   - It returns the top recommendations based on similarity scores.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the Python script (`recommender_system.ipynb`) and provide a query, such as "funny videos of pets". The system will return the top relevant video titles.

2. **Testing**:
   - Experiment with different queries to see various recommendations.

## Example Query
Recommending based on the user's bio: `"I am a Data Scientist who loves cute dogs"`

The system will recommend video titles like:
- `"What is this cute puppy dog doing?#Shorts"`
- `"I played weird virtual pet games"`
- `"Naming My 1-Month-Old Rescue Puppies!"`
- `"I asked an AI for video ideas, and they were actually good"`

Recommending based on the user's watch history, previously watched videos: 
1. `"We Put Our ENTIRE Team in ONE Game of Fortnite"`
2. `"The guys from fortnite"`
The system will recommend video titles like:
- `"Surprising FaZe Jarvis With His Dream Fortnite Girls"`
- `"25 minutes of Rainbow Six Siege VIBING"`
- `"MY FORTNITE SKIN REVEAL"`

## Future Improvements
- Add more features to the recommender system, such as filtering by video categories or view counts.
- Experiment with different embedding models to see if they provide better recommendations.
- Add a web interface to allow users to interact with the recommender system more easily.
